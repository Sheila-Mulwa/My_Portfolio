# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hello, I'm **Sheila Mulwa**, a data scientist and data analyst with a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights and solutions.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 📊 [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sheila-Mulwa/SyriaTel_Customer_Churn-Project)
This machine learning project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. By applying **logistic regression** and **random forests**, I built a model that identifies high-risk customers, helping the company take proactive steps to retain them. 

**Key Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

### 📈 [Sales Dashboard Analysis](https://github.com/Sheila-Mulwa/Linear-regression-Modelling-in-Data-Science)
An interactive **Power BI** dashboard that visualizes sales performance trends over the past 5 years. I used **linear regression** to identify key factors influencing sales and presented them through engaging, easy-to-understand visualizations.

**Key Techniques**: Data visualization, Power BI, linear regression, trend analysis

### 🧠 [Revenue Report Automation](https://github.com/Sheila-Mulwa/REVENUE-REPORT_AUTOMATION)
This project focuses on automating the generation of detailed **revenue reports** for a business. I developed a system that **integrates data from various sources**, processes it, and generates formatted reports, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. The automation also incorporates visualizations for easy decision-making by stakeholders.

**Key Techniques**: Data integration, report generation, automation with Python, data visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
